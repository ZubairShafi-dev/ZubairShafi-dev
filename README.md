# Hi there, I'm Zabi 👋

<!--
This README uses a dark‑theme aesthetic with a light/dark banner and dynamic sections.
The `<picture>` element will switch between dark and light banners based on the reader’s
preferred color scheme.  GitHub currently supports this syntax.  Feel free
 to modify the assets in the `assets/` directory or replace them with your own images.
-->

<p align="center">
  <picture>
    <!-- Dark mode banner -->
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="./assets/banner-dark.png">
    <!-- Light mode fallback -->
    <img alt="Banner" src="./assets/banner-light.png" />
  </picture>

## About Me

I’m **Zubair “Zabi” Shafi**, a senior Android app developer based in Lahore, Pakistan.
With extensive experience in building robust mobile applications, I specialize in Kotlin,
Java and Jetpack Compose, and I have a passion for crafting beautiful, intuitive user
interfaces.  When I’m not writing Android code, you’ll find me exploring cross‑platform
technologies like Flutter and experimenting with modern backend frameworks.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

Here are some of the tools and technologies I work with regularly:

- **Languages:** Kotlin, Java, Dart, JavaScript, Python
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** Jetpack Compose, Android Jetpack, Flutter, React Native
- **Tools & IDEs:** Android Studio, VS Code, Gradle, Git
- **Cloud & DevOps:** Firebase, Google Cloud, GitHub Actions, Docker

You can tell I enjoy working across the full development lifecycle — from ideation and UI
design through deployment and CI/CD.
