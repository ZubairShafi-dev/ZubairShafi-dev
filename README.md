# Hi there, I'm Zabi 👋

<!--
This README uses a dark‑theme aesthetic with a light/dark banner and dynamic sections.
The `<picture>` element will switch between dark and light banners based on the reader’s
preferred color scheme.  GitHub currently supports this syntax【900122833949546†L60-L67】.  Feel free
to modify the assets in the `assets/` directory or replace them with your own images.
